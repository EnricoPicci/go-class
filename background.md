# Where all this comes from

At the beginning of 2020 I was already interested in the Go programming language. I was finding its mix of simplicity and power fascinating.

Then came the pandemic.

While home-frozen like the rest of the world, I decided I needed something intellectually stimulating to help me overcome the night.

At the same time, thinking about the Go programming language, I realized that:

- I had developed some hands on experience but I was lacking a clear top down vision of its architecture and design principles
- I would have liked to help the spread of the knowledge of the language

I am convinced that if you want to teach something you have to have a good knowledge of the details of that something but, more importantly, you need to have a good top down picture of that same something. Conversely, if you start thinking about teaching something, you are naturally brought to create a top down vision of that thing for yourself.

So I decided to start writing the material for a class I was imagining to teach to students who wanted to learn the Go programming language.

After more than three years this is the result of that decision. I hope it can be helpful.
