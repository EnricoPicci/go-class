# Read a file and print its content

This is an example of a program that reads a file and prints its content.

If the file is not found, an error message is printed and the program exits with exit code 1.

Run the program with the command

`go run ./src/file-system/read-file/.`

## Test

There is a test that tests that, if the file that we want to print does not exists, the program exits (crashes).
