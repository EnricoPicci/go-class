# Exercize 1

Implement the function mostFrequentWordWithCount so that it returns both the word that is encountered most times in the file
and the number of occurrencies of this word. The name of the file to read is passed as the first command line argument.

Adapt the logic of the function mostFrequentWord to implement the new requirement.

To build and execute (with a sample file) this program run the following 2 commands:

- go build -o ./bin/mostFrequentWord_Ex_1 ./src/not-so-simple-program/exercise-1
- ./bin/mostFrequentWord_Ex_1 testdata/count-words/file-with-two-unique-words.txt
