# A not so simple program

This is an example of a not-so-simple program that shows:

- how to use functions defined in the same package or in other packages (the helpers package in this case)
- how to define a function (mostFrequentWord in this case) called by another function (main in this case)
- how to declare variables
- how to perform a loop

This program prints the word which is most frequent in a file.

The file path is passed as first commnad line argument.

The program does not aim to be precise. For instance if the file has 2 words which have the highest count, only one will be printed.
