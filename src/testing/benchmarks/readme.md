# Benchmarks

## Concat strings benchmark

[This benchmark](./concat-strings_bench_test.go) measures the efficiency of different ways of concatenating strings.

## Compiler optimizations can affect benchmarks

[This example](./compile-skip-code_bench_test.go) shows how optimizations brought in by the compiler can affect the accuracy of a benchmark.
